Call it under two weeks for most all observations.

If we limit it to just first&full  for leaf&flower observations 
is it more consistent?

from which we can guess our common clones are the late bloomers since the delta 
is mostly positive which indicates they followed in reported phenophase

Just about half observations are within the week window of fudge which counts as close enough 
to count as the same time as it could have been if it had the same clone genotype.

From what we have, the five non-clone individuals which we have reports 
at the same exact location of "more-than-one individual clone" 

 - in 2017 '85078' was about a week early

 - in 2017 '80942' has four reports two of which are likely typed incorrectly
	(is that flower and leaf not correctly differentiated?)


 - in 2013 '37124' is nominally in sync with our clones 

 - in 2014 '65713' somehow had "first" leaf bud reported 8,7 & 2 weeks before our clones.

 - in 2014 '20068' started earlier than our clones but in the subsequent three years 
	it was spot on 


so a several of non-clones adjacent to clones have no significant difference
a couple have probable data quality issues and might be better than they look.

Recall these location "points" are likely accurate to about half a football field
sized patch and are before any attempt to make sensible neighborhoods around our common clones.


If we relax the constraint of there being more than one clone 
at the exact location of the non-clone 
(that was more for establishing a nominal clone phenophase window)
we can get   141   observations of non-clones alongside a clone .... 
seeing one with a phenophase delta of 8 months

maybe time for a brief foray into data quality

Question: Is there a partial order available for the phenophases? 
NPN does have a data quality section ... 

I may have to do a bit more looking at the first yes/no stuff
my understanding that the clones are in someones yard 
and they are reporting on their own plant they got explicitly to report on 
but that might not be the whole picture.

although I may be able to tease out chains of (trivial) leaf partial order  
and another one for flowers
it does not look like  I should expect to find any order between the two
(maybe a dogwood specialist could come up with a few specific rules of thumb but meh)  

so I should redo collapsing to min times for yes observations 
as later ones could just be when someone else happens to wander by.

I could also look at the 'no's and time to last y/n to help reality check the yes's.
