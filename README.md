### DogWood days of spring  overview

There may not be a linnear path here so roughly chronogicaly with loops
are the  plain text  READMEs I tend to generate for myself in passing.


[Climate/README_backfill.txt](Climate/README_backfill.txt)  was the first thing
I looked into when Bryan posted the Dogwood data. Seemed having climate data
going back covering older phenophase reports could help train the ML.
It is not left in a horible state, the full season values should  usable if need be
but it does not stop and provide the partial accumulatios to dau of observation.

[README.postgis](README.postgis)  is about setting up postgres/postgis
to hold the various datasets (COUNT focused) & qgis to visualize it.
